I’m a 14-year-old programmer in New York City. I specialize in JavaScript and Python development, but I’m also currently delving into the C/C++ world. You can browse most of my code on Github.

## Stuff I've done

Some of my most reputable and public projects are Count, launchnow. Anyways, I’m trying to get as much coding experience as I can because this is the best time to do so! Technologies are advancing, and my skills right alongside them.

## This website

Tailwind has been a game-changer for my web development career. It makes creating responsive sites very easy because of one simple thing it does: get's rid of media queries.

I've always been fine with CSS (although classes can be a hassle), but media queries had to go. With TailwindCSS, you can just add breakpoints like sm: or md: to specify code to run when on different sizes. If you haven't tried Tailwind, I suggest you do.
